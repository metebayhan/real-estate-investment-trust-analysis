# REIT Return Analysis with NumPy

This project analyzes two Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), SBRA and EQR, using NumPy.

Daily simple returns and logarithmic returns are calculated from adjusted closing prices. The project then computes:

- Average daily simple returns  
- Annualized log returns (252 trading days)  
- Daily variance (sample variance)  
- Daily standard deviation (sample standard deviation)  
- Correlation between SBRA and EQR  

The goal is to demonstrate basic financial analysis using NumPy, including return calculations, risk metrics, and correlation.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy

## Features
- CSV price data loading
- Simple and log return calculations
